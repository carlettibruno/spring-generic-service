# spring-generic-service

Create a generic service and rest controller layer using the "CrudRepository" as base.

This project has been created to turn more fast expose some generic service.
Following the HTTP concepts, like as POST, PUT, GET, DELETE and your relative response.

I will need improve some HTTP features, but this way already work for most cases.

I putted a samples for controller, service, model and repository (that's not important, because the spring provides the "CrudRepository" for us). The tests has been created to guarante to us that rest calls will be occurr as expected.
